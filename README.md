#Visualstudio code -Online Payment Fraud Detection System
This is a machine learning-based web application built using **Flask** that predicts whether an online payment transaction is **fraudulent or genuine**.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To detect fraudulent online payment transactions in real-time using a trained machine learning model.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for web framework)
- HTML,Css,Javascript (for frontend form)
- scikit-learn (for model building)
- Pickle (for saving/loading model)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional dependency)

## 🛠️ Features

- Takes transaction details as input (type, amount, balances)
- Predicts whether the transaction is fraud or not
- Web interface made using HTML and Flask
